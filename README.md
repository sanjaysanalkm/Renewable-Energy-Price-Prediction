# FORECASTING SOLAR POWER GENERATION - RENEWABLE ENERGY
- Forecasting can play an important role in prediction of energy from solar wind energy resources. It can provide insights on the weather conditions, sun irradiance and demand for electricity. 
This can help in optimization of energy storage to meet the energy demands during the peak times.
- The energy demand can be anticipated with the information on the expected changes in the renewable energy generation, including up-ramps (increase) and down-ramps (decrease). Hence, the operators can anticipate the likelihood of shifts in the renewable energy.
- Scheduling can be done such as Intra-day that involves real-time adjustments to power generation and consumption based on short-term forecasts, and day-ahead scheduling that helps in planning power generation and allocation for the following day based on long-term forecasts.

### CHALLENGES INVOLVED IN FORECASTING
- The generation of the power can vary with the intensity of the energy sources (Solar or Wind).
- The accuracy many not be perfect.
- The other factors influencing are Plant Maintenance and presence of dust particles on the panels.
